# Light Jekyll scaffold

Jekyll scaffolding for using and autocompiling CoffeeScript and Sass.

    gem install jekyll
    gem install foreman
    gem install compass

Run:

    foreman start

To watch site build, `.sass` and `.coffee` files.

Read [this blog post](http://kapteijns.org/2014/03/31/jekyll-sass-coffeescript.html) about where to put your files. It's not hard, really. `.sass` files go in `_sass` and `.coffee` files go in `_coffeescripts`. They compile into `css` and `javascripts`.
